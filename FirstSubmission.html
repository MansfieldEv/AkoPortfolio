    <h1>Mana Tangata</h1>
    <h3> I'll be honest. This first submission is bleak. My experiences in schools scared me, the talks made me anxious. But the young people? They give me confidence that I am in the right place. They give me the confidence to be vulnerable and face the unknown, knowing I am on the right waka, with the right whānau.</h3>
    <h3> If you feel like you need a break, play the side scroller. You wont win, and its still pretty basic - but thats the point. This first entry is about my drive to try, to face the unknown with my back, guided by the past. And who cares if its basic? I am here to learn and absorb and do better than before. Tēnā koe.</h3>   
    <h2>A Lesson Observed</h2>
    <p>A Year 9 group (24 tauira) sat a unit test. The energy in the room was disorganized, disengaged, and disinterested—from both kaiako and tauira. A number of students did not answer any questions and did not respect the teacher when asked to focus on the test and stop talking. Some actively rebelled by trying to use their phones and cheat off each other. This led to the kaiako announcing that anyone talking would lose 5 points. The students, however, called this bluff, and nothing changed—indicating to me that this wasn’t the first time such behaviour had occurred.
        The teacher didn’t engage much with students' names or make eye contact. They were short with the tauira and uncommunicative, which led to an outburst from one student who threw their paper away in frustration. At the end of the lesson, the teacher commented, “Sometimes you have to be that way with them; otherwise, you know what they’ll end up like” (K. Prasad, personal communication, November 27, 2024). This statement had clear undertones of bias and, to me, felt racially targeted.
        While I acknowledge that it was the end of the school year and that teacher-student relationships may not be at their best during this time, I firmly believe that the issues I observed went deeper than mere end-of-year exhaustion. They reflected systemic problems within the education system. Unfortunately, this was not an isolated incident. Many other participants shared similar disheartening observations, with phrases like the one described above being heard from various teachers on multiple occasions.
        </p>
    <p>At the time, I was in shock at what I was witnessing, especially after coming from camp week, which had been filled with such beautiful and uplifting messages. Immediately afterward, I felt overwhelmingly sad—not for myself, but for what could be the reality for these tauira. Looking back now, I feel angry.
        I kept thinking about a quote from the hīkoi:</p>
    <h4>“…what’s good for Māori is good for everyone” (McCaull, 2024). </h4>
    <p>All I could think about was how much better the dynamic in that classroom could have been if these individuals had been acknowledged for who they are and empowered in their identities. This recognition would have profoundly improved their learning experience. I already knew there were issues in the education system, but seeing them in action—and feeling unable to speak out in that environment—was both heartbreaking and deeply motivating. The continued marginalization of cultural communities in Aotearoa, along with the educational disparities that come with it, remains an ongoing issue. While these inequities are more publicly discussed today, they continue to be justified through deficit thinking in schools and across the country.
        Recently, Otago University’s medical school identified a troubling pattern within their enrolments: a consistent negative relationship with socioeconomic status, coupled with poor representation of Māori and Pacific communities in medicine. They recommended policy changes to address these disparities, stating that “communities in greatest need of doctors are prioritised for enrolment into medicine… and the government fund more New Zealanders to study medicine” (Bagg et al., 2023).
        However, ACT Party leader David Seymour described this as “racial discrimination,” claiming that these communities already had equal opportunities and that the only difference was their “family tree.” His comments triggered a review of these policies (Davison, 2024). These injustices are well-documented in literature, yet they are often rejected or dismissed by our current government. Is it any surprise, then, that we see these inequities reflected in our schools? No, but it reaffirms my commitment to being here, in the right place, to reject this kind of thinking and challenge our systems to be better—for the future of Aotearoa.
        </p>
    <p>There is a reason why STP 1, committing to tangata whenuatanga and the Te Tiriti o Waitangi partnership in Aotearoa, is the first teaching standard. There are many ways to achieve this, but they all revolve around active principles: understanding, recognizing, acknowledging, practicing, and developing (Education Council, 2017). STP 1 is essential for affirming Māori learners’ place, knowledge, and tikanga as Māori. Westernized schooling, or ‘whitespaces,’ weaponizes cultural individuality to conform to Westernized ‘sameness’ (Milne, 2009). What I observed in the classroom essentially stripped these students of their culture and identity, likely contributing significantly to the resentment and disengagement I witnessed. When the 1877 Education Act was established, the assimilation into Westernized teaching practices and the denial of tradition and culture led to this response: “For the majority of children, school became a site of resistance, an arena of cultural conflict exacerbated by teachers…” (Jackson, 2016, p. 25).
        For these young minds to form positive connections with their learning environment, it starts with building relationships where they feel acknowledged, and their culture is recognized.
        STP 4 is essential for creating a culture of learning characterized by respect, inclusion, and empathy. In such an environment, students feel confident in their identities, cultures, and abilities (Education Council, 2017). Currently, only a small fraction of Māori learners are enrolled in Kura Kaupapa Māori compared to English-medium schools, despite achieving much higher NCEA success rates—63% compared to 50%, respectively (Walker, 2016). This data clearly shows that the reciprocal relationships and inclusion of whānau knowledge and culture in Kura Kaupapa Māori foster a better learning culture, leading to improved outcomes.
        Integrating these principles into English-medium schools can begin with simple actions, such as pronouncing names correctly and learning about students’ iwi and hapū. It can extend to integrating culture and ideas into classroom activities—not as a token, but in meaningful ways that allow students to connect personally and develop a greater sense of purpose in their communities. For example, acknowledging tikanga during a science experiment or discussing the importance of native plants to different communities in various contexts are small but impactful steps. These practices are not difficult to implement and have a profound effect on the identity and wellbeing of our tauira.
        </p>
    <h2>A Lesson implemented</h2>
    <p>The lesson was designed around planting a small shrub with a group of Year 10 students. It built on knowledge from a previous lesson about plant organs and their functions, while also introducing the concept of kaitiakitanga in the living world and its relevance to their local environment. The lesson was co-taught with another science teacher from the cohort and observed by a Kaihāpai and the students’ regular teacher.
        Science is not a subject that many students choose to pursue at NCEA levels across Aotearoa or within this school. Of the approximately 1,500 students enrolled, only one NCEA science stream is offered per year at each curriculum level. Based on student opinions gathered within the school, which highlighted disengagement and dislike for various aspects of the subject, this lack of interest was not surprising. Students commented that “they don’t do anything fun in science” and “they just get talked at.” One particularly distressing comment from a tauira asked to talanoa about their science class was, “Okay. But please just don’t yell at us.” While it is worth noting that these experiences occurred toward the end of the year—when engagement and energy levels are often low and may not reflect the most productive time—these remarks still stood out to me as a plea for relational and culturally relevant teaching approaches that engage students as individuals. This need aligns closely with the principles described in Te Kotahitanga (Bishop & Berryman, 2009), which emphasize effective, relationship-based teaching. It was this understanding that inspired the hands-on, culturally rooted lesson designs, aimed at creating a more meaningful and engaging learning experience for these students.
        </p>
    <p>When I joined the program, my motivation stemmed from observing how many students at the university seemed lost, lacking real passion or drive for what they were doing. Many viewed university as simply “the next expected thing” rather than a meaningful pursuit. While the opportunity to attend university is a privilege, I saw this as a significant failure of the school system. These students attend school to learn, yes, but the role of adults in their journey is crucial in helping them reach their full potential.
        I knew that educating was my calling, but I felt university was too late. To truly help students, I needed to be in schools where I could engage with them directly. At the school, I saw students full of drive and potential, eager to share their energy with me and each other when given the right outlet. The way they effortlessly bounced ideas off one another and questioned me as individuals was a testament to what I believed: they had the tools to be great and expected greatness when given the guidance and motivation to do so.
        It wasn’t until later, when I read Dylan Wiliam’s work on formative assessments, that I fully understood the importance of students being active owners of their own learning—and of their classmates’ learning as well (Wiliam, 2011). This idea reinforced everything I had believed: these students were capable of expressing and owning their identities and passions, even if they thought they were disengaged with the subject. It was empowering and uplifting, reassuring me that I was exactly where I was meant to be—supporting and nurturing these young minds, even if they weren’t yet fully aware of the amazing potential they were beginning to unlock.
        I think MJ summed it up perfectly during camp week: 
        </p>
    <h3>“I might not be the person to spark change, but I might spark the mind that does” (Johansson, 2024).</h3>
    <p>From implementing my own lesson, one thing became clear to me: teachers are almost always part of the problem. A study in 2020 surveying teachers across all school levels identified several priority areas, including: focusing on the whole child, including creativity and student agency, cultural responsiveness, and whānau engagement (Hood, 2020). Just four years ago, teachers themselves were acknowledging that they did not practice STP 1 and 4 well, even though they recognized how important these practices were. This is a big reason why I keep these practices at the forefront of my mind, particularly as a Pākehā. I never want to lose sight of who these STPs are meant for. I come from privilege, and I’ve never tried to hide that—but I approach these practices with caution, especially when working with an audience who 100% knows more than I do.
        Bishop (2019, p. 65) discusses how non-Māori imposing cultural knowledge on Māori students is often resented, as it is seen as a ‘cultural takeover.’ However, a discussion from Bishop & Berryman (2006) helped me understand how cultural awareness can translate into responsive pedagogy. This can be achieved by questioning the nature, focus, and student identity/wellbeing within our relationships.
        This was the second lesson we implemented, and after the first lesson, I immediately noticed during our CREATE observation that I had failed to nurture or include language and culture. I felt as though this failure could affect the relationships I had with these tauira. This is why, during the second lesson, kaitiakitanga was a central theme. The tauira were encouraged to act as kaitiaki during the planting process and to reflect on how this concept related to their lives and identities outside of the classroom.
        Two things are worth mentioning here:</p>
    <p>1.	I had no idea what kaitiakitanga was before planning this lesson, but I knew it was an important cultural concept for essentially all the children in my classroom, so I made sure to learn as much as I could.</p>
    <p>2.	It wasn’t intimidating to talk to the tauira about this concept; in fact, it was an honour to discuss it with them in a way that everyone could contribute and connect. Students sang to their plants, made connections to other places where kaitiaki is observed, and asked thoughtful questions.</p>
    <p>I was able to see in practice that honouring these two STPs is a blessing for our tauira and their whānau. With a little dedication and a commitment to continuing my learning and application of these practices, I saw how these young minds embraced and connected to this work. I strive to keep making this effort, learning new ideas, and integrating them into my classroom wherever possible.</p>
    <h2>A Personal Learning Experience</h2>
    <p>Graeme Aitken, a very honest and emotional speaker, spoke during Hauora week to educate us on Interpersonal Teacher Behaviour. Graeme provided valuable insights into navigating student attention, creating a family-like learning environment, and teaching in the North-East (Aitken, 2024).
        Despite speaking in front of more than 60 of us, he was incredibly open and honest. While this intensive has been uplifting and enriching, it was truly wonderful to hear someone with such passion and knowledge also share their negative experiences. This vulnerability served as an important reminder to take care of ourselves, to recognize when things become overwhelming, and to acknowledge when we need to take a step back.
        In 2023, a survey of 1,591 educators found that 58% were likely to leave the teaching profession within the next five years, and 60% cited the time required to maintain good practice as a major factor contributing to this high turnover (Teaching Council of Aotearoa New Zealand, 2023). When I applied for my current teaching job, my principal exclaimed how “excited [we are] to have someone who is excited, full of energy, and ready to engage” (G. Moore, personal communication, September 25, 2024). While this is true—I am that person—I do feel nervous about the potential for quickly developing burnout. I don’t want any burnout to impact the learning environment or the relationships I build with my students.
        </p>
    <p>I am young and full of energy, but I am also a little afraid of the journey ahead. This program does an amazing job of preparing me, and I am so thankful for all of it, but I am nervous about how my health and my relationships with students will be connected and, subsequently, affected. Combined, these concerns make me question if burnt-out teachers unload their frustration onto their students.
        During a seminar by Margaret Ross, she said, “Whatever a child says to you is not about you…but what you say to them is about them” (Ross, 2024). Principals in Aotearoa New Zealand’s secondary schools and kura have already expressed their concerns about high staff turnover due to increasing workloads and staff feeling undervalued, which leads to burnout. Teachers, desperate to avoid burnout, are leaving (PPTA Te Wehengarua, 2023). My concern is that in this high-turnover, high-stress environment, where does our tauira’s learning—and, more importantly, their well-being—fit into this?
        Russell Bishop discusses that to teach to the North-East and give marginalized learners the support and environment to thrive, we need to create and interact within a family-like context (Bishop, 2019). But how do we create that environment in a high-turnover, high-burnout atmosphere, where a learner might feel let down by a teacher, rather than by a broken system? Graeme discussed that when we teach, we should not forget about the East. What resonates with us as teachers will resonate because it works for our learners. We learn how to be consistent, but also to express our natural feelings and be honest. We express both our interests and theirs. We show them that they are so much more than learners—they are human, and so are we.
        Haim Ginott’s conclusion on this matter sums it up well: </p>
    <h4>“I am the decisive element in the classroom. It is my personal approach that creates the climate…” (Ginott, 1972, p. 15).</h4>
    <p>Whenever I feel like I am losing my "why," I renew my whakapapa with the world around me, focusing on my Tūrangawaewae and my journey towards the North-East. A pillar of the Māori ethical framework in whakapapa, which includes aroha, tūmanako, and whakapono, is considered an essential requirement in Te Ao Māori. It creates a responsive and ethically considerate approach (The Pūtaiora Writing Group, 2010). Only when all of these pillars of whakapapa are respected can Māori be empowered to take kaitiaki in a project, leading to tangible outcomes and strong relationships built on faith and truth. This process is applicable not only to ethical research but also in the classroom. This proverb reflects this idea and how the framework mirrors my teaching practice:</p>
    <h2>kia u ki te whakapono, kia aroha tetahi ki tetahi</h2>
    <h3>Hold strong to your beliefs and care for one another</h3>
    <p>When I experience burnout and start to lose my "why," I strive to remember my beliefs. To affirm my learners with care, high expectations, and respect—and, importantly, to care for their culture and their positionality (relative to me) as partners in Te Tiriti o Waitangi. As Graeme said, “Sometimes the natural response is wrong when delivered poorly”—take that second to remember, this is for them. I will constantly ask myself how I am nurturing the whakapapa of my spaces and whether I need to refocus on my Tūrangawaewae to remember my duty to uphold Te Tiriti o Waitangi, constantly recentering myself towards the North-East. In this way, transformative environments are created. As an educator aiming to uphold Kaupapa Māori theory, I respect the indigenous ways that challenge Western ideas, and with the Vā that comes with strong teaching pedagogy and whakapapa, I will encourage and promote cultural knowledge so tauira can become confident and empowered in their own knowledge (Smith et al., 2017).</p>
