    <h2>A Lesson Observed</h2>
    <p>At a South Auckland Co-ed Kura, I observed a Year 10 class, a Māori and Pasific group stream. They were working on Chemical reactions, running experiments on how carbon dioxide changed the pH and composition of solutions. The room was set up with tables in groups, and while there was a whiteboard on one side of the room, it was not explicitly clear where the front of the room was. The teacher was incredibly active and involved in the room and its space. He was constantly moving around, addressing the class only when necessary, and otherwise engaging with students at the tables and guiding them through the experiment. He opened and closed the lesson with a Karakia, that 99% of the tauira engaged in on both occasions. 
        </p>
    <p>My knowledge of the school is that it is deeply rooted cultural background, with more than 70% of the school identifying with a Māori or Pasific background, and only 10% identifying as European/Pākehā (Education Counts, 2025). I am also aware the college works closely with their community in environmental and real-world applications, and science in particular work with closely with students and external programs to support equitable outcomes for the students in the Kura, gaining national, and well deserved, interest (Royal Society Te Apārangi, 2025).</p>
    <p>Its was a beautiful opportunity for me to see tauira in a space where they were all seen and heard as individuals. It reminded me how  important and transformative manaakitanga is as an effective interaction for learners (Bishop, R., & Berryman, M., 2009). Especially after coming from my last portfolio, where I observed some very impersonal teaching, it was so refreshing to see a space where mana was a critical part of the classroom. Teachers from other schools have said incredibly mana damaging things to me: “Sometimes you have to be that way with them; otherwise, you know what they’ll end up like” (K. Prasad, personal communication, November 27, 2024). While this was a big challenge to break this down – this has encouraged my outlook to see teachers and spaces where mana is lifted and encouraged. I believe all young people have new perspective and ideas that force us to acknowledge gaps in our own understanding. When asked how CO2 could be monitored detected in our breath, students linked this to how a breathalyser works, understanding that ethanol in our breath changes the composition and that was how alcohol levels could be detected – independent from the kaiako and the ways he was trying to explain the concept, and he loved the idea so much he shared the idea with everyone. A recent framework by Webber (2024), called the Mana model, discusses how sense of self, connectedness, and wellbeing are motivated by the desire to achieve a sense of mana that can be enhanced in the right learning environment. It encourages me that acknowledging and empowering mana has become such a central idea in some teaching environments, and encouraged me that positive change is already happening in our system – one classroom at a time. </p>
    <p>In that classroom all I saw was a dynamic and engaged group of individual who cared about each other and their kaiako. The weren’t necessarily engaged in the work every second of the class, which is something I wouldn’t never expect from any classroom, but they were consistently engaged with each other and with their kaiako. The dynamic was powerful, and very engaging where they were so involved in and supported each other’s learning, as described by Wiliam (2011). Even in the chair design – groups where they could support each other when I was busy with something else. Most of my schools classrooms aren’t modelled like this, and I am told they can’t be moved, so I adapt by creating activities that make them get up and move around and interact with other classmates and share their ideas. This helps to build their confidence and hopefully help to enhance each other’s mana when they share success. </p>
    <p>This focuses STP 4, Learning-focused culture. The idea is to build a space where I can design and promote a safe and open learning space that is steered by me at first, but becomes collaborative, empathetic, and brave (Education Council, 2017). As I have gotten to know my learners, their needs, and their cultural and spiritual mana,  it also means I am making more impactful decisions for learning, and catering to learners and moving at the pace they to succeed. Taking this time to know the content and my learners is deeply rooted in relationship-based teaching, specifically caring and nurturing for the learners (Bishop, 2019). I sometimes feel as though the curriculum does not allow this flexibility and the utilization of prior knowledge, especially in senior, NCEA restricted classes. If I continue in teaching, I think this will become a big part of my practice, advocating for flexibility and acceptance of all types of learning and using ALL background knowledge and mana to build a curriculum for all learners. </p>
    <h2>A Lesson Implemented</h2>
    <p>I implemented a simple lesson on understanding how different elements on the periodic table reacted differently based on where they sat on the periodic table. When I prepared the lesson, it was fairly simple. A range of different types of examples and several different ways to solve the problem – how reactive is this, what is its atomic structure, how does this relate to its position on the periodic table? The idea was not to solve all the problems – but to find a way that worked for them individually, then they could work as a team to explain it to a different group. What I anticipated was that they would pick a way that worked for them, they would work through the examples to build confidence, I would then group them in the ways that they had picked, and they together would work through an example for the whole class. However, they just started helping each other answer all the other questions once they started finishing one section. Sure, they checked with me, and I was floating around, but for the most part they helped each other until most people had finished all the examples. National reports suggest engagement and achievement in science typically reduces as they move through school (Te Ihuwaka, 2021), and at my Kura only a small majority are currently achieving curriculum expectations in year 9 and 10 (Education Review Office, 2024). To see my classroom functioning independently and them  celebrating their own success is the kind of engagement and hopefully success I want my tauira to continuously feel. </p>
    <p>Curriculum success is a big focus for my Kura. I understand the importance of curriculum and success for a future, but autonomy is such a big part of forming the sense of self in a world that is so dominated by social media and authority that does not necessarily reflect them or their community. The idea of being told what you are and what you are not capable of leads to rebellion, and the continual exposure to social media and they expectations of others can be so deeply damaging to a child’s sense of self without them even realising (Sahebi, S., & Formosa, P., 2022). However, seeing these young, active minds in a space where they were allowed take risks and support each other was such a nice reminder that they have so much wonderful potential. It has confirmed to me exactly what Ako Mātātupu is striving to show so many young minds across the Motu: </p>
    <h4>Ko te piko o te māhuri, tērā te tupu o te rākau</h4>
    <p>It has strengthened my commitment to rejected deficit explanations (Bishop, 2019), and reminds me always that the path to what success looks like (to them) starts when you embrace your individuality and see mistakes as opportunities to learn and take the next step forward. For a particular ākonga, a conversation with their whānau highlighted this disconnect: “…shuts down and disengages when he does not understand or connect with the content” mindset (J. Maul, personal communication, March 7, 20245). It is a reminder that without the encouragement to try when things are hard, shutting down is safer than trying – an attitude I will continue to reject and work to remove from my students.</p>
    <p>The idea was loosely based off the jigsaw design (Sherrington, T., 2019), but with the added twist that they identified what they were comfortable with to use that as a safe space and a safe teaching opportunity. However, by the end of the lesson they were asking ME hinge questions about different elements and different reactions, and about how things were different for elements we hadn’t even talked about, or needed to talk about. It related well to the ETP6, teaching, where I was able to respond to my learners and adapt to what they needed – which was honestly less from me and more freedom for them (Education Council, 2017). I think this reflective of my classroom environment, and they way in which we have built a combination of relationships. Me with them, them with me, them with each other, my relationships with their peers out of class, with authority figures in the school. It is also worth saying that the mood of a classroom can change so quickly. One day we can be like this, but if they have a bad test in Math, or there are big rumours circulating around the school about a peer, the dynamic and resistance can be more challenging to maintain. To minimise these days and maximise our days where I am barely needed – I need to keep building and maintaining relationships where we are honest with each other, described well in Farrelly, T., & Nabobo-Baba, U (2014), where they describe talanoa as speaking from the heart.</p>
    <h2>A Personal Learning Experience</h2>
    <p>The last term has been incredibly challenging for me and my mental health. I love interacting with the tauira, I love the relationships we have built and most of the time I love the four hours a week I spend with them. But the emotional and physical toll teaching has put on me has been the hardest times of my life. During a check-in with the second-year cohort, someone recommended speaking to our councillor Adrienne if you were ever struggling. We had our session and spoke mostly about unrealistic expectations and how setting those for myself and my classroom is creating an additional weight I am not sure I am equipped to deal with. I feel as though we spend so much time teaching resilience to our young people, and the importance of trying to overcome and process our struggles, but I myself do not feel equipped to process these emotions myself.  Mental health in youth is declining, with more than 20% of survey participants dealing with poor mental health indicators, which rose from 10% when last sampled in 2012 (Kim, S., & Low, F., 2024). Promoting resilience is so important but I feel as though I finally am getting a glimpse into the mental health of a teacher, and what sort of front they put up for their tauira. </p>
    <p>I am an incredibly empathetic person. I have been told consistently that my empathy is a weakness. There is a wealth of literature that suggests that is not the case in teaching, and that empathy is what connects us to our learners (Aldrup et al., 2022). Mental health and wellbeing for teachers however is an incredible different story. Stress, burnout, anxiety, and depression are frequently identified in teacher studies (Agyapong et al., 2022), and even in two terms I feel as though I have experienced all of these outcomes. I believe this is a very noble profession, and the work and ideals we represent are important and our impact on the future is incredibly important – but this is incredibly tough work. I believe in hard work, but I need to learn to lower my expectations of myself and of my tauria. All it does is create a more frantic atmosphere in the classroom, which my kids notice, and force me to look at situations that don’t go exactly as I planned as incredibly negative and a reflection of my abilities as a kaiako. It challenges me everyday and is a struggle I am always battling – but is has taught me how to be honest with my students, and embrace the wins when we get them, and acknowledge the lows together and move past it together.</p>
    <p>One junior ākonga becomes particularly distressed when she gets anything other than excellence, despite her participation in various activities and her large contribution to the wider community. I was her. My whole academic career was so focused on success that every failure (i.e. not an A+) was crushing. I give her the space she needs to process her grade (which has never dipped lower than an M) and then give her the talk I wish a teacher would have given me. </p>
    <h4>She is good at this. She is so bright and talented. She is too hard on herself. She is a joy to have in my classroom, and I am so glad I get to teach such a wonderful soul.</h4>
    <p>There is value in showing the perfectionist that being perfect is not what makes them amazing. There is so much joy in enjoying life and not stressing so much about the little things, as long as you gave it a good go – which we all always do in my spaces. It reminds me so much of kotahitanga – that we are both reflecting on achievement to move forward together (Bishop, R., & Berryman, M., 2009)., even if moving forward means embracing a hard day or a poor result. It helps me better design and approach learning design and teaching (Education Council, 2017), as I learn to embrace the craziness of teaching and let go of some of the control, it helps me better empathise with some of the new and significant stress and new environments they are learning to navigate as well. </p>
