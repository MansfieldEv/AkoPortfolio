    <h1>Practicing Excellence</h1>
    <h2>A Lesson Observed</h2>
    <p>After spending the year observing so many secondary schools, I went and observed a Year 1 class at a Kura tuatahi out in West Auckland, right around the corner from my Kura. The role is 447 as of 1 July 2024, and just under half the school role identifies as Māori or Pasific (Education Counts, 2025). The school has a prominent commitment of Hauora, and their initiatives (ō tātou mahi), are hugely focused on building resilience, movement, and critical thinking (Ō Tātou Mahi, 2025).</p>
    <p>The class I shadowed did a variety of different schoolwork; Math, handwriting, singing, and physical education. A common theme throughout the day was a huge variety of group or teamwork activities. In math they would take turns subtracting from 5 and figuring out what was leftover as partners, and then with the class, and then individual teams would come up and give an example of their math in front of their classmates. No one was shy – and no one was shamed when they got it wrong, it was an opportunity to learn. The same attitude was shown in PE. They split into two teams and continually encouraged each other to try their best.</p>
    <p>All around the classroom and the Kura there was a collective sense of agency – of Mana ūkaipō (Webber, 2024).  I think a big part of that stemmed from the leadership of the kaiako in the classroom. The kaiako I observed had been at this Kura for almost 20 year. A number of my colleagues children went through their classroom, and were now adults themselves. They all said the same thing when I told them who I was observing: “They are the most amazing teacher – they’ll remember them {their kids}”. I think that was really interesting, because they actually said a similar thing when I was there;</p>
    <h4>I never wanted to move into senior management, I just really want to teach and be here for my kids” (H. Dobbie, Personal Communication, September 9, 2025).</h4>
    <p>It was an incredible change in perspective to see how collaborative the classroom was, and how the learning and trial and error included the kaiako as well. Years 0 – 8 at this Kura, and a number of other Kura across the country use the Oxford mathematics, a programme designed to use whole class and explicit instruction to guide students through the programme (Oxford University Press, 2025). After observing it in action, it was so amazing to see how well the kids worked together in small groups and then as a whole class. It was very explicitly asking questions, from Rosenshine’s principles (Sherrington, 2019). All students were active participants, and each student was given the opportunity to check their understanding and correct their misconceptions in a low stress environment. It was interesting to see how different that is in high school – that sense of whole class commitment and checking really disappears the older our tamariki become, and they develop some fear around actively checking. This is more of a reflection on how we as kaiako change how we assess and check across different levels of education, and should not be put on our children.</p>
    <p> It was interesting to even consider how the  arrangement of the room had changed from this Kura to our Kura. Their desks are all in groups facing each other. There is plenty of opportunity for group discussion and ideas and no clear direction as to where the front of the room is. In my Kura, all classrooms are arranged to face the front of the room, presumably towards me as the instructor. There are no group tables, no group discussion space, and I have even in the past been told off for trying to rearrange the classroom to be more table or group based. I am a firm believer that explicit instruction is important – but I do really believe that if you are truly going to engage the tauira in the learning they need to be engaging each other as resources and check points for learning, utilising professional learning (STP 2) to enhance our outcomes (Education council, 2017). Dylan Wiliams embedding formative instruction utilises the students as learning resources for one another in a way that increases involvement, learning interactions, and benefits long term knowledge (Wiliams, 2011). I have strived to minimise how much time I am talking at them, while still effectively being explicit under Rosenshine’s principles, giving them more opportunity to monitor their own position in the class and the classes collective progress. John Hattie describes it well as reciprocal teaching – where teaching is done first, followed by a reciprocal dialogue with the students (Hattie, 2009). By this way I aim to minimise the stress of trying to process complex scientific information by my tauira working together, while alongside me, to help identify where next we need to collectively steer the conversation and places I can more critically feedback to individuals and the class collectively.</p>
    <h2>A Lesson Implemented</h2>
    <p>I have been focusing this term on building resilience in my junior classes. The idea was to use a variety of methods to build a sense of individuality and confidence in learning and engagement. An opportunity to implement this came during our energy topic last term. Each ākonga worked as a group of 2/3 as well individually to design a healthy home using what we have learnt about heat transfer and different types of energy. They had a week to do it – and could design the house however they wanted. I would recap what we were doing at the start of every lesson and ask one person to volunteer something new they had learnt about house design to set the tone of the lesson, and to indicate that it was not me teaching them – they had a chance to teach me something. One the second day of research, a boy who often doesn’t participate put his hand up to share, saying “low ceilings and low smaller building”. Sure, I thought, less to heat, more efficient. But he went on to tell us that’s why the wharenui has lower ceilings and aren’t always huge buildings – it was good for when they were spending nights there. It opened up a dialogue the lead a significant portion of the lesson around traditional design where I had no real knowledge previously, and we as class could discuss what they saw in their homes and meeting places. We had single entrances to a marae, controlling the cold air coming in, special stuff in the walls – pink pats in their current homes but what was used traditionally? Raupō, as we learnt, and suddenly they were talking about how their families still weave with flax. They may not even have realised at this point we were still talking about science, but in a way that they were all confident to share and bring themselves into the conversation.</p>
    <p>Culture and acknowledgement of the learner will always be a big part of my curriculum. It is crazy how the time files when the tauira are able to bring themselves into the curriculum, and it makes me question why we don’t do it more often. It also helps me realise how big the gaps are in our national curriculum in terms of acknowledging mātauranga Māori, with very little links to ancestral knowledge, and very weak links to Aotearoa’s diverse flora and fauna in terms of our tauiras perception of it (Te Poutāhū Curriculum Centre, 2024).</p>
    <p>A huge body of research shows learners who feel as though they are allowed to express themselves are more likely to engage in the learning (Wang & Degol, 2014). Unfortunately, our young Māori and Pasific people constantly see the opposite by our leaders and those deemed ‘knowledgeable’. The Treaty Principles Bill was a blatant breach of Te Tiriti o Waitangi, and furthering the gap between our indigenous communities and those in power who, based on this bill, seek to control and undermine indigenous knowledge and peoples (Jones, 2024). This is unfortunately nothing new in this space. In 2021, seven University of Auckland academics published a letter in The Listener writing mātauranga Māori had no place in science, claiming “…the notion that science is a Western European invention and itself evidence of European dominance over Māori and other indigenous peoples” (Dunlop, 2021). While the University immediately renounced any support toward this letter and the statements it made – it made national headlines, and consumed the newsrooms. I can not imagine how a passionate young person would feel reading these opinions, or how this would damage their mana, which was never met with a formal apology or any sort of retribution. A response since then has highlight the negative effects this marginalisation and blatant racism has had on Māori outcomes across not only health, but the number of university students, academic job hires, and advancement in their respective fields (Waitoki, 2022). I am outright disgusted that this is just a ‘well researched fact’ – and these public parades of disrespect, racism, and barriers to success or even acknowledgement continue to be allowed within our system. </p>
    <p>I have spent three terms getting to know my tauira in a way that lets them bring whoever they are into my classroom. This comes with a big responsibility – their lives become very open with me and that is a wonderful and very eye-opening privilege. I have been working on better ways to acknowledge who they are as individuals while respecting and giving power to their mana. Sometimes as a Pākehā I feel as though I carefully tread the line between acknowledgement and respect versus tokenistic representation. If you were just to take the word of those who occupy the public space, as discussed above, Pākehā involvement seems to be contributing to the problem of marginalisation and devaluing a wealth of knowledge and culture. As cynical as I feel about this topic and the treatment, I watch people I care about; friends, colleagues, my kids, go through trials while I do not face the same scrutiny; I do see change happening around me in my classroom in small ways.</p>
    <p>Bishop (2019) suggests caring and nurturing for the learner as a key factor of relational Teaching to the Northeast. My room is a safe space for my tauira to see me as a kaiako where they can be who they are, and say what they really think about whatever we are discussing. I think it is important to acknowledge when they are teaching me something – and really emphasis how much value I see in each of their ideas and views! This thinking led to me thinking more critically about how I am designing my classes around opportunities for them to bring their own knowledge into the discussion. This helps me more critically evaluate STP5 and STP6, where I can take our current curriculum and ensure there is an opportunity of their voices to be heard in a way that embraces their views without shooting down other opinions or backgrounds to help promote individually and collective agency (Education Council, 2017; Webber, 2024).</p>
    <h2>A Personal Learning Experience</h2>
    <P>I have had a particularly challenging year in terms of my involvement in violent incidents at the Kura. As of the end of term 3, I have been involved in 5 major event – 3 inside my classrooms and 2 during duty times around the Kura grounds. The last, and by far the most violent incident happened two days before the end of term 3. A student returned from the bathroom distressed with three other students (including one excluded individual) aggressively following them. I locked the class inside the room while the pursuing individuals tried to break through the door to get at my student. I did my best to keep everyone calm, get everyone away from the doors, calm the student who was chased back into the classroom, and try and get help from other kaiako in neighbouring classrooms to try and calm down or removing the attacking individuals behind the door. Our SLT (senior leadership team) and deanery team are very responsive to such events, and quickly dispersed the students, but as this was the last class of the day once the school was deemed ‘safe’, the students were instructed to go home. I did not see them the following day, but on the Friday, we had our counselling team come in and talk through the incident with the students and provide them with options of people to talk to or places to seek help if they were distressed. SLT was also present to very transparently tell the whole class what had happened and what were the next steps and punishments for those involved in the incident, including one student in my class who attempted to escalate the situation as it was unfolding on the day.</P>
    <p>We preach so often around building resilience and strategies in their days at the Kura help our young people to cope with what life throws at them. Studies have shown that adolescents who had access to educational support systems were more likely to have more resilience and perform better in high pressure situations (Mesman et al., 2021). When this all happened, I had senior management say to me –“They just don’t have any resilience to deal with these things, the just sort of lash out and it doesn’t matter who’s problem they make it” (B. Curran, Personal Communication, September 18, 2025). It made me realise that we day to day start to build resilience by challenging our kids, but is explicit enough to deal with high pressure situations like the one I experienced with my tauira? How are we ensuring Hauora is holding up their, and my, Whare Tapa Wha?</p>
    <p>There are programs that have been developed to specifically address this in the post COVID-19 years, such as the FRIENDS Resilience programme in all ages of South Auckland Kura (Education Gazette, 2024). We do not have that programme in our school, but we do have an amazing team of counsellors that our ākonga can be referred too, or as the majority of cases, refer themselves too. Since the launch of the counselling in schools initiative in 2021 the MoE has seen an increase in wellbeing, mental health, and signs of improved learning (Te Ihuwaka, 2024). Interestingly the report states most referrals are by teachers, admittedly some schools are junior which is at a different processing level to senior school, but at our Kura more than 50% of referrals are self-referrals – indicating we collectively may be able to seek help when we need it, as it is individually needed.</p>
    <p>My empathy and willingness to engage in these difficult situations is part of what makes me a good educator, and has been shown in studies to improve student outcomes (Aldrup et al., 2022). After the incident in my classroom – I was confident we needed to discuss it further and make sure everyone was okay. While some ākonga in the room did not think it was a big deal, there would also be a group of young people in that classroom who had never experienced that before – and both ideas really upset me. It was worst on the next day when several parents contacted the school because they and their child were afraid and worried. It made me feel like I had failed them and not protected them or been clear with them at the time what was happening. It was a challenging time, and I was so thankful to have a professional village alongside me; SLT, counsellors, and the science department. Collectively we worked together to ensure everyone understood the procedures, what came next, and the best thing we could do for our tamariki and their whānau as soon as we could. I haven’t always felt the professional relationship (STP3) at the Kura, but this really brought us all together and helped us clearly communicate how we could feedback and forward responsibly (Education Council, 2017).</p>
    <p>The Te Kotahitanga ETP perception of kotahitanga might be focused on student success (Bishop & Berryman, 2009) but as of right now I see kotahitanga as an opportunity to sit with my class and be open and honest about the event. I wanted to emphasise that before we moved forward, it was okay to be okay, and it was also okay to not be okay. I think it was also important for me to be transparent with them, as I always aim to be, that I was not okay and was really scared. In terms of bringing this into how our classroom operates I was thankful to have SLT and counselling present to be as open as possible. Creating a family-like context reflects learning environments, but in this space and I could really feel we were creating an environment where it was okay to talk, and no one would be confrontational, but use this dialogue to learn from each other and move forward to encourage progress and ultimately learning (Bishop, 2019).</p>
